 I am a senior scientist at AudioSourceRe in Ireland, where I develop music source separation technologies. My PhD work started off from my interest to apply MIR technologies in music education. Since then, I have worked in sound source separation, music information retrieval, computational musicology, audio processing, among other research topics. Since 2012, I am the CSO and co-founder of Songquito, a small company that builds 
music education apps such as [Song2See] (https://www.song2see.com). I previously worked at A*STAR in Singapore, and at  Fraunhofer  IDMT in Germany. I have worked in a number of applied research projects with industry partners, as well as in European, German, and Asian research projects.
